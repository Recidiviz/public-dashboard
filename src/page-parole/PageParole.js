      Parole is a period of supervised release after prison. Releases from
      prison to parole are granted by the parole board. People on parole must
      regularly check in with their parole officer, who ensures that they are
      following all the requirements of the release. If these expectations are
      violated, the personâ€™s parole may be revoked.
